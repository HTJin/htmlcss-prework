    <h1>I am an aspiring Web Developer</h1>
    <div class="content">
      <p>&emsp; I am devoted to meticulously delivering clean, practical web applications. I'm a fan of efficient, minimalistic user-centered design and try to make them into a reality. Your imagination is the limit.</p>
      <p>&emsp; I co-founded a community at University of Pittsburgh for an accidentally popular game, Super Smash Bros Melee. Pitt Smash Bros Club has become one of the largest gaming communities for the general Pittsburgh E-Sports and grassroots culture. Pre-Med college student turned Computer/Information Science, I decided to discover and explore a career path that is more suited to my passion for content creation and interactivity/accessibility for end users.</p>
      <p>&emsp; My love for creating something new was instilled at my very first job at a startup. It was a remote position for a web agency that designed and developed new web apps for other startups in New Haven, Connecticut as well as coming up with an effective business strategy of agile timelines to deliver to our clients. It was a fulfilling experience where I was exposed to a number of Javascript frameworks such as React, Angular, and lit-elements. I am always looking to improve and always interested to keep learning. Most recently I successfully delivered the very first Vue project for my current company with no prior precedent of having a project written with Vue.</p>
      <p>&emsp; I have previously tried to head a front end team and co-created a personal project of a Registration web app for another gaming community on campus. I taught friends/students who were interested in getting involved with coding for their resumes.</p>
